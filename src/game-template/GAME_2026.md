This document provides a comprehensive overview of the 2026 FRC game for scouting reference.

---

## Match Timing

| Period | Duration |
|--------|----------|
| **Autonomous** | 20 seconds |
| **Teleop** | 2 minutes 20 seconds |
| **Total Match** | 2 minutes 40 seconds |

---

## Game Pieces: FUEL

- **Description**: Dense foam ball, approximately 6 inches in diameter
- **Capacity**: Unlimited (as many as fit in the robot)
- **Preload**: Robots may start with up to **8 fuel** preloaded

### Fuel Sources on Field

**Total Fuel per Match: 504** (may increase to 600 at Championships)

| Source | Amount | Description |
|--------|--------|-------------|
| **Depot** | 24 per alliance (48 total) | Ground-level fuel along alliance wall |
| **Outpost Chute** | 24 per alliance (48 total) | Human players feed through chute |
| **Robot Preload** | Up to 8 per robot (48 max) | Teams choose preload amount |
| **Neutral Zone Pile** | 360-408 | Center pile (varies based on preloads) |

> [!NOTE]
> Field staff may have difficulty counting fuel precisely. The Neutral Zone quantity may fluctuate ±24 fuel.

---

## Primary Objective: Scoring FUEL in the HUB

Each alliance has a HUB located in their alliance zone. Robots score by depositing fuel into their alliance's hub.

### Hub Dimensions
- **Opening**: 41.7" hexagonal opening at the top
- **Height**: 72" (6 feet) off the carpet
- **Width**: 47" total
- **Fuel Distribution**: 4 exits at the base distribute processed fuel back into the Neutral Zone

### Scoring Points

| Action | Auto Points | Teleop Points |
|--------|-------------|---------------|
| Fuel in **active** HUB | 1 | 1 |
| Fuel in **inactive** HUB | 0 | 0 |

### Hub Active/Inactive System

The hub status alternates throughout the match based on **which alliance scored more fuel during Auto**. The Auto **winner gets the first INACTIVE shift** (a penalty for winning):

| Match Timeframe | If RED Wins Auto | If BLUE Wins Auto |
|-----------------|------------------|-------------------|
| **AUTO** (0:20 → 0:00) | Both Active | Both Active |
| **TRANSITION** (2:20 → 2:10) | Both Active | Both Active |
| **SHIFT 1** (2:10 → 1:45) | RED Inactive, BLUE Active | RED Active, BLUE Inactive |
| **SHIFT 2** (1:45 → 1:20) | RED Active, BLUE Inactive | RED Inactive, BLUE Active |
| **SHIFT 3** (1:20 → 0:55) | RED Inactive, BLUE Active | RED Active, BLUE Inactive |
| **SHIFT 4** (0:55 → 0:30) | RED Active, BLUE Inactive | RED Inactive, BLUE Active |
| **END GAME** (0:30 → 0:00) | Both Active | Both Active |

> [!IMPORTANT]
> **Strategic Implication**: Winning Auto gives you the first inactive shift. Both alliances can always score during Transition and Endgame.

---

## Secondary Objective: TOWER Climbing

Each alliance has **one tower** in their alliance zone. The tower is a ladder-like structure with multiple rungs.

### Tower Structure
- **Tower Base**: Ground level platform
- **Tower Wall**: Gold-colored wall panel
- **Support Structure**: Purple uprights
- **Low Rung**: Blue rung
- **Mid Rung**: Red rung (higher)

### Scoring Criteria

| Level | Auto Points | Teleop Points | Requirement |
|-------|-------------|---------------|-------------|
| **Level 1** | 15 | 10 | Robot not touching carpet or tower base |
| **Level 2** | — | 20 | Bumpers completely above Low Rung (blue) |
| **Level 3** | — | 30 | Bumpers completely above Mid Rung (red) |

### Climbing Rules
- Robot must be contacting the **rungs or uprights**
- Robot may additionally contact: tower wall, support structure, fuel, and/or another robot
- **Auto Climbing**: Maximum of **2 robots** can earn Level 1 points during Auto
- **Teleop Climbing**: Each robot may only earn points for **one level**

> [!NOTE]
> **New for 2026**: Robots can climb during Autonomous for bonus points! This is a significant strategic opportunity.

## Ranking Points

Alliances can earn Ranking Points beyond just winning the match:

| Condition | Ranking Points |
|-----------|----------------|
| **Tower Threshold**: 50+ combined tower points | +1 RP |
| **Fuel Threshold 1**: 100+ fuel scored | +1 RP |
| **Fuel Threshold 2**: 360+ fuel scored | +1 RP (additional) |
| **Win** | +2 RP |
| **Tie** | +1 RP |

> [!TIP]
> An alliance can earn up to **2 bonus RPs** from fuel alone if they score 360+ (satisfies both thresholds).

---

## Robot Restrictions

| Restriction | Limit |
|-------------|-------|
| **Weight** | 115 lbs maximum |
| **Perimeter** | 110 inches maximum |
| **Height** | 30 inches maximum (starting config) |
| **Extension** | Up to 12 inches beyond frame, **one direction only** |

### Field Traversal: Trench vs Bump

Robots have two ways to move between the Alliance Zone and Neutral Zone:

#### The Trench (Drive Under)
- **Dimensions**: 65.65" wide × 47" deep × 40.25" tall
- **Clearance**: 50.34" wide × **22.25" tall** underneath
- Extends from the guardrail to the bump on both sides

> [!TIP]
> **Strategic Consideration**: Robots shorter than 22" can drive under the trench for faster field traversal.

#### The Bump (Drive Over)
- **Dimensions**: 73" wide × 44.4" deep × **6.5" tall**
- **Ramps**: 15-degree angled ramps on both sides
- Located on either side of the HUB

> [!NOTE]
> **Design Choice**: Teams must decide whether to prioritize going UNDER the trench (shorter robot) or OVER the bump (taller robot). This affects climb ability and fuel capacity.

## Field Layout & Zones

The field is **symmetrical** with distinct zones:

### Zones

| Zone | Dimensions | Description |
|------|------------|-------------|
| **Alliance Zone** | 158.6" × 317.7" | Scoring area with HUB, TOWER, and DEPOT. Bounded by Robot Starting Line. |
| **Neutral Zone** | 283" × 317.7" | Center area with fuel pile, HUBs, TRENCHES, and BUMPS. Includes center line. |
| **Alliance Area** | 360" × 134" | Off-field area behind driver stations (not playable) |
| **Outpost Area** | 71" × 134" | Off-field area by outpost (not playable) |

### Field Markings

| Marking | Description |
|---------|-------------|
| **Robot Starting Line** | Alliance-colored line spanning field width at the edge of Alliance's base |
| **Center Line** | White line bisecting the Neutral Zone |
| **Human Starting Line** | White line 24" from Alliance Wall, spans to Outpost Area |

### Key Field Elements

| Element | Description |
|---------|-------------|
| **HUB** | Hexagonal scoring target, 72" tall with 41.7" opening |
| **TOWER** | Ladder structure for climbing (1 per alliance) |
| **TRENCH** | Drive-under structure, 22.25" clearance |
| **BUMP** | Drive-over ramp, 6.5" tall with 15° angle |
| **DEPOT** | Ground-level fuel area along alliance wall |
| **OUTPOST** | Human player station on field sides |

### Human Player Interaction: Outpost System

Fuel can leave and re-enter the field through the OUTPOST system:

| Component | Description |
|-----------|-------------|
| **Chute** | 15° sloped tunnel where human players load fuel (~25 capacity) |
| **Chute Door** | Rotatable door human players use to release fuel |
| **Corral** | Opening at base (32" × 7") where robots push fuel OUT of the field |

> [!NOTE]
> - Robots can push fuel into the CORRAL (bottom opening, 1.88" off ground)
> - Human players collect fuel and reload it through the CHUTE
> - 2 outposts per field (1 on each end)

### Scoring Rules

> [!IMPORTANT]
> - **Fuel can only be scored in your Alliance Zone** (where your HUB is located)
> - **Fuel can be LAUNCHED from anywhere on the field** (long-range shots are legal)
> - This creates opportunities for robots with accurate shooters to score from the Neutral Zone

### Protected Zones & Defense Rules

> [!CAUTION]
> The **TOWER is protected** while robots are climbing (off the ground). Interfering with climbing robots is a foul.

**Defense Rules:**

| Rule | Description |
|------|-------------|
| **3-Second Pin** | Robots cannot pin an opponent for more than 3 seconds |
| **No Path Blocking** | Cannot shut down major parts of play by blocking all paths |
| **Hub Fuel Rule** | Cannot catch/intercept fuel coming out of hub exits - it must hit the ground first |

### Robot Starting Positions

All robots start behind the **Robot Starting Line** (alliance-colored line at the edge of the Alliance's base, in front of the barriers and HUB).

## Zone-Based Scouting Actions

Different actions are relevant depending on where the robot is on the field. This should inform the scouting UI:

### Alliance Zone (Own)
**Available Actions:** Score, Collect, Pass

| Action | Description |
|--------|-------------|
| **Score** | Deposit fuel into the HUB |
| **Collect (Depot)** | Pick up fuel from the depot |
| **Collect (Outpost)** | Receive fuel from human player chute |
| **Pass to Corral** | Push fuel into outpost corral for human player |

### Neutral Zone
**Available Actions:** Collect, Pass

| Action | Description |
|--------|-------------|
| **Collect (Pile)** | Pick up fuel from center pile |
| **Collect (Ground)** | Pick up loose fuel (from hub exits or dropped) |
| **Pass to Alliance** | Transfer fuel to alliance partner |

### Opponent Alliance Zone
**Available Actions:** Collect, Defense

| Action | Description |
|--------|-------------|
| **Collect (Hub Exit)** | Pick up fuel exiting opponent's hub |
| **Defense** | Disrupt opponent scoring/collection |

> [!TIP]
> **Why track non-scoring actions?**
> - **Passing ability** indicates alliance coordination potential
> - **Collection efficiency** shows intake capability and cycle time
> - **Hub exit collection** reveals opportunistic play style
> - Understanding fuel flow helps predict alliance compatibility

- [ ] Climb attempted (Level 1 only)
- [ ] Climb successful
- [ ] Leaves starting zone

### Teleop Period (2:20)
- [ ] Fuel scored (total count)
- [ ] Fuel scoring rate
- [ ] Hub targeting during active/inactive windows

### Endgame
- [ ] Climb level attempted (1, 2, or 3)
- [ ] Climb level achieved
- [ ] Climb time (impacts fuel scoring window)

### General
- [ ] Defense played
- [ ] Defense received
- [ ] Robot issues/breakdowns
- [ ] Can go under trench?
